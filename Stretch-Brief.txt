Combine everything you've learnt:
- Create a new GitHub repo called "PythonStuff". 
- Make a directory called Pandas_Data_Prep
- Within this, you have one task: Show off your data pre-processing skills. Thing to include...
	# 1. Check for missing values and handle them appropriately.
	# 2. Check for duplicate rows and remove them.
	# 3. Inspect and standardize categorical columns for inconsistencies (e.g., case sensitivity).
	# 4. Detect and handle outliers in numeric columns.
	# 5. Create new features or transform existing ones (e.g., from columns like "Date" or "Amount").
	# 6. Convert categorical columns to numerical values (e.g., using label encoding or one-hot encoding).
	# 7. Handle dates: Convert date columns to datetime format and extract useful features (e.g., year, month).
	# 8. Clean text columns by removing special characters, extra spaces, and converting to lowercase.
	# 9. Bin numeric columns into categories (e.g., grouping ages into categories like 'Young', 'Middle-aged', 'Old').
	# 10. Ensure the integrity of numerical data by ensuring no invalid values (e.g., negative ages or impossible values).
	# 11. Check for inconsistent or unexpected data types and correct them.
	# 12. Normalize or standardize numeric columns when needed.
	# 13. Drop irrelevant columns or rows that will not be useful for analysis.

Dataset: 
- You may chose any dataset.
- There is however a famous public dataset called "IMDb Movie Dataset". 
- This can be found on Kaggle or IMDb's official website: https://datasets.imdbws.com/ 
- If you use the imdb web link, this will be Tab Separated Values with the gzip compression.
- pd.read_csv() will work with a few additional arguments...
